# Oh My Harness Repository Instructions

## Authority Map

- `agents/global-instructions.md` owns the global behavior distributed to every selected harness. This root file owns only repository-local routing and deltas; keep global policy out of it.
- `.agents/harnesses/registry.json` is the distribution authority. Keep its schema and `scripts/harness_registry.py` consumer aligned in the same change.
- `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md` is the canonical repository skill catalog. Plugin manifests, marketplace state, generated metadata, caches, and harness directories are projections.
- `README.md` owns current lifecycle and validation entry points. Architecture decisions and migration invariants belong in `docs/adr/`.

## Conditional Guidance

- Before renaming, replacing, or migrating any repository-owned identifier, path, field, event, skill, or instruction identity, read `docs/agents/internal-identifier-evolution.md` and classify every scoped match before editing.
- When changing a plugin's packaged content, finish all source edits first, run the owning tests, then run `scripts/update_plugin_generations.py` once and validate the resulting single current identity.
- For anything under `plugins/mattpocock-skills/`, follow its scoped `AGENTS.md`. The published `skills/` mirror remains upstream-owned.
