# Make `omh` the post-bootstrap lifecycle manager

`install.sh` and `install.ps1` are bootstrap-only entry points. They may create the
manager home, clone the first managed checkout, install the stable bootstrap shim,
build the tooling environment, write launchers, and invoke the initial
`omh install`. After that point, all supported lifecycle mutation is owned by
`omh`.

The public harness lifecycle is:

```text
omh install [HARNESS...]
omh refresh [HARNESS...] [--repair]
omh remove HARNESS... | --all
omh update [--check] [--channel stable|main] [--to REF]
```

`install` adds a harness to desired state after successful materialization.
`refresh` reconciles the current local release without fetching remote source.
`refresh --repair` is the explicit same-version re-materialization path and may
repair content-identity drift that ordinary refresh correctly rejects. `remove`
deletes only resources whose ownership can be proven and removes the harness
from desired state. `update` is the only normal command that fetches manager
source; it validates the target distribution identity in an isolated worktree,
switches the managed checkout, re-enters the new CLI after rebuilding tooling,
refreshes every desired harness, and rolls back the checkout and distribution if
the new revision cannot close.

The manager namespace owns self-lifecycle:

```text
omh manager repair
omh manager uninstall
```

`manager repair` reconstructs the recorded checkout before rebuilding tooling,
launchers, and desired harnesses. `manager uninstall` requires an empty desired
set unless `--with-harnesses` is explicit, validates the bounded manager-home
shape, and schedules deletion through the external bootstrap interpreter so
Windows does not need to delete the running Python environment in place.

`state/install.json` remains the immutable initial-install lifecycle receipt.
Rolling state lives beside it:

```text
state/
├── install.json
├── manager.json
├── desired.json
├── harnesses/
├── operations/
└── manager.lock
```

`manager.json` records the current repository/revision/release/bundle/channel.
`desired.json` owns the installed harness set and update policy. Per-harness
receipts are written only after closure. Mutating commands share one
cross-process manager lock. An update writes an operation journal before
checkout mutation; a failed rollback leaves that journal in a degraded phase and
blocks normal interpretation until `omh recover` is run.

The generated public launchers execute a manager-home bootstrap shim rather than
the repository wrapper directly. The shim is standard-library-only, keeps
`omh --help` available without rebuilding tooling, repairs the tooling environment
before lifecycle execution, and can reconstruct a missing managed checkout for
`omh manager repair` from the recorded repository and revision. Repository
`upgrade_oh_my_harness.sh/.ps1` wrappers remain legacy
compatibility surfaces but are no longer the public launcher authority.

No-subcommand `omh` remains a compatibility alias for `omh refresh`. New scripts
and documentation must use explicit subcommands.
