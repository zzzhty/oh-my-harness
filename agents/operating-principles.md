# Agent Operating Principles — Repository Map

This is the repository-managed support note installed at `$CODEX_HOME/agents/operating-principles.md`. `agents/global-instructions.md` owns global authority, safety, failure handling, verification, delegation, and subagent-failure policy. Root `AGENTS.md` owns only `oh-my-harness` repository routing and deltas. This file maps those owners to reusable workflow surfaces; it does not expand their authority.

## Managed Source And Target

```text
source: agents/operating-principles.md
target: $CODEX_HOME/agents/operating-principles.md
```

Edit the repository source, not the installed target. `scripts/sync_codex_agents.py` writes a managed header and refuses to overwrite an unmanaged same-name target unless a reviewed `--force` operation is explicitly chosen.

## Durable Owner Map

| Concern | Repository owner |
| --- | --- |
| Global agent behavior, mutation boundaries, failure handling, test policy, and delegation authority | `agents/global-instructions.md` |
| Repository-local routing and conditional guidance | root `AGENTS.md` |
| Installed Codex support paths and assignment mapping | this file |
| Reusable workflow behavior | `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md` and the skill's direct references |
| Plugin/runtime architecture and commands | the owning plugin `README.md`, scripts, and validators |
| Active multi-turn work | `docs/todo/README.md` and the named active plan or goal |
| Watcher evidence and proposals | `$CODEX_HOME/watcher/` runtime state |
| Generated reports or automation memory | the owning tool's documented report or memory root |

Choose the narrowest owner that future agents can inspect. Do not duplicate a global rule in a skill or support note merely to make it more visible; point to the owner and state only the local workflow delta.

## Delegation Routing

Keep capability, authority, and workflow invocation separate:

- The harness exposes subagent capability.
- `agents/global-instructions.md` or an active plan authorizes delegation and write scope.
- `$orchestrate-subagents` defines the detailed workflow only after the user explicitly requests that skill, subagents, parallel agents, or multi-agent delegation.
- Broad read-only review authorization comes from `agents/global-instructions.md`; it does not invoke `$orchestrate-subagents` by itself.

For an invoked orchestration workflow, read:

```text
plugins/workflow/skills/orchestrate-subagents/SKILL.md
```

The skill owns branch routing, slicing, assignment contracts, disjoint write ownership, waiting, partial coverage, and consolidation. `agents/global-instructions.md` remains the authority for whether delegation or mutation is allowed and for how failures affect integration.

## Assignments And Permissions

Use one unique `task_name` per assignment. The assignment prompt carries the task, context, permission, expected output, stop condition, and boundaries.

- A read-only assignment names the bounded inspection surface and explicitly forbids edits and commits.
- An implementation assignment names every disjoint writable path and keeps shared files, generated artifacts, integration, and cross-slice validation parent-owned.
- `task_name` identifies the assignment; it does not grant a role, capability, mutation authority, or a persistent agent identity.

The parent accounts for every selected assignment and independently reviews its evidence before integration.

## Custom-Agent Boundary

This repository does not maintain or install custom-agent preset TOML. Add one only through a separate active plan that records:

- the repeated workflow that `task_name` assignments plus prompt-declared permissions cannot express;
- model, sandbox, fallback, and availability behavior;
- ownership and parent-integration boundaries;
- sync validation and rollback;
- conflict handling for write-capable agents.

Custom-agent work must not broaden read-only review authorization into implicit mutation.

## Scheduling And Monitoring Boundary

Scheduled or repeated workflows must define the trigger or schedule, exact command or tool, working directory, inputs and output contract, allowed and forbidden actions, report or memory location, validation or freshness checks, and stop condition. For `long-running-goal`, use its narrower runtime hard-stop boundary.

For wall-clock schedules, preserve the user-visible local time unless the user explicitly requests UTC, and verify the written automation state before reporting the schedule.

## Memory Writeback Boundary

Write back only durable, reusable knowledge: user preferences that affect future work, validated commands, recurring failure modes, workflow contracts, open loops or close criteria, and privacy or mutation boundaries. Do not write secrets, full private prompts, full tool responses, unverified assumptions, one-off noise, or implementation details that are cheap to rediscover.

Memory updates must remain reviewable through file paths, diffs, or report artifacts.

## Sync And Validation

Preview and apply the managed support-file projection:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --dry-run --prune
python3 scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --prune
```

Validate an installed copy without changing it:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --check --prune
```

When `$CODEX_HOME` is unset, the script targets `~/.codex/agents/`. Preserve unrelated files; prune removes only files carrying the script's managed header.
