# Watcher

Watcher consolidates the former DocWatcher and Skill Watcher plugin surfaces into one package while preserving separate skill invocation boundaries.

The plugin owns two runtime domains:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/watcher/
├── doc/
│   ├── audits/
│   ├── reports/
│   └── repo-state.json
└── skill/
    ├── logs/events.jsonl
    ├── reports/
    ├── proposals/
    ├── turns/
    ├── schema-version.json
    └── skill-metadata-cache.json
```

On `SessionStart`, Watcher rebuilds `skill-metadata-cache.json` from the repository-authoritative callable catalog at `scripts/repo_skill_catalog.py` under one explicit oh-my-harness repository root. Marketplace metadata, plugin manifests, plugin cache, and the runtime cache never enumerate callable skills. A missing or invalid explicit repository root, canonical catalog failure, unsupported attribution-overlay schema, or invalid skill relationship stops the refresh visibly.

Repository-owned `.codex-plugin/skill-watcher.json` files are non-callable attribution overlays keyed by durable namespaced Watcher identities. They retain roles, aliases, supporting-skill relationships, logical groups, and legacy mappings without defining the callable inventory. Declare `supporting_skills` only for unconditional dependencies that participate whenever the primary skill runs, because Watcher adds every declared dependency to effective usage; alternatives and conditional branches remain undeclared. Use `explicit-workflows` for skills whose contract requires explicit user selection or confirmation and `implicit-primitives` for skills the model may select from natural-language intent. Skill reports apply grouping at report time, so existing logs can be reclassified without rewriting historical events.

Packaged skills:

- `doc-alignment`: audit or align documentation, scripts, skills, runbooks, operational entry points, and planning folders against current source of truth.
- `housekeeping`: remove inventoried disposable files, generated caches, stale runtime artifacts, and post-migration physical clutter while preserving durable state.
- `skill-maintainer`: analyze skill usage evidence and propose bounded `SKILL.md` maintenance updates without automatic source mutation.
- `skill-compressor`: reduce skill or plugin instruction footprint while preserving operational semantics.

Current migration scope:

- Source skills and direct skill resources have moved under `plugins/watcher/skills/`.
- Report/audit scripts live behind the unified `plugins/watcher/scripts/watcher` entrypoint.
- Python implementations live in the named `scripts/watcher_runtime/skill` and `scripts/watcher_runtime/doc` packages; callers and tests use those modules through `main(argv)`, not direct script paths.
- The former DocWatcher cockpit backend/frontend and legacy patch/PR/provider/webhook surfaces were not migrated into the active plugin source. Git history remains the recovery path for those retired experiments.

Use the unified CLI from the Watcher plugin root:

```bash
export OH_MY_HARNESS_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
omh_tooling_python="${OH_MY_HARNESS_HOME:-$HOME/.oh-my-harness}/venv/bin/python"
"$omh_tooling_python" -B scripts/watcher doc report --config config/repos.example.json --print-report
"$omh_tooling_python" -B scripts/watcher skill report --since 7d
"$omh_tooling_python" -B scripts/watcher migrate-state --dry-run
```

`config/repos.example.json` resolves the audited checkout from
`OH_MY_HARNESS_ROOT`. Keep that variable bound to the canonical Git worktree so
the same config remains valid when Watcher runs from either source or an
installed plugin cache.

Skill `observe`, `install-hook`, and `doctor` accept `--repo-root`; when omitted they require `OH_MY_HARNESS_ROOT`. Installed command hooks embed the resolved root explicitly, so SessionStart behavior does not depend on the process working directory, a plugin-cache path, or adapter-path inference. `$CODEX_HOME/watcher` remains runtime state only.

Doc audit configs may define multiple named profiles for one repository. Keep current authority,
generated/upstream site, and history scopes separate:

- use `profile: "current-authority"` with explicit `docs`, `authority_paths`, active
  `watch_terms`, and `link_validation.mode: "markdown-relative"`;
- use `profile: "upstream-site"` with the repository's owner checker through
  `link_validation.mode: "owner-command"` instead of applying generic Markdown rules to a
  framework-specific route or asset dialect;
- use `profile: "history"` with `finding_policy: "report-only"` and no active watch terms.

Treat `owner-command` as trusted, unsandboxed execution. Watcher invokes its argv without a
shell, keeps its configured working directory inside the repository, enforces a timeout, and
bounds captured output, but cannot prove that the command is read-only. Review the
repository-owned validation workflow before configuring it.

`authority_paths` is an existence check for configured authority entry points. It does not prove
semantic equality or precedence between documents. The legacy `source_of_truth` config key remains
read-compatible but is deprecated. `check_change_alignment: false` disables the code-without-doc
heuristic for profiles where that comparison is not meaningful.

### Repository skill-root discovery

When `docs` is omitted, Watcher scans the normal entry files and documentation directories plus the
first existing repository skill root in this default priority order:

1. `.agents/skills`
2. `.codex/skills`
3. `.github/skills`
4. `.claude/skills`
5. `.grok/skills`

Watcher checks each complete skill directory, so an empty `.agents/` parent does not shadow an
existing fallback such as `.codex/skills`. Profiles may override the order with a non-empty
`skill_root_candidates` string list. The one-off audit CLI provides the repeatable
`--skill-root-candidate` option for the same purpose.

Use `@repo-skills` as a semantic path in configured `docs` and as a prefix in
`authority_paths`. For example:

```json
{
  "docs": ["AGENTS.md", "@repo-skills"],
  "authority_paths": ["AGENTS.md", "@repo-skills/README.md"]
}
```

The token resolves per repository from the ordered candidates. Ordinary configured paths stay
fail-closed: a literal stale `.codex/skills` path is reported missing and is not silently redirected.
If multiple candidate roots exist, Watcher reports the selected root and the shadowed roots and emits
a Medium finding when the resolved skill scope participates in that profile. A resolved-root change
also changes the effective config hash so commit-dependent audits become due immediately.

This resolver does not locate the Watcher config file itself. A moved
`.codex/watcher-doc-audit.json` still requires the caller's `--config` path to be updated.

Run `"${OH_MY_HARNESS_HOME:-$HOME/.oh-my-harness}/venv/bin/python" -B scripts/watcher migrate-state --apply` to move `$CODEX_HOME/skill-watcher/` to `$CODEX_HOME/watcher/skill/` and `$CODEX_HOME/doc-watcher/` to `$CODEX_HOME/watcher/doc/`. The migration refuses to merge if the target already exists.
