# Long Running Goal

## Trigger And Ready Contract

Use only for an explicit request naming this skill or one of its lifecycle actions, or a confirmed conversion. Otherwise use system planning; suggesting this skill does not authorize creating its contract.

Only `Ready` pre-approves frozen non-destructive local work; `Draft` does not. Unresolved required design, permissions, input acquisition plans or placeholders keep a goal `Draft`. A fully specified later action may await sourced approval under `components/planning-preflight.md` while earlier authorized milestones proceed. Readiness and action pre-approval do not themselves start execution.

Before creation/conversion, or first implementation without a supported completed marker, apply `components/planning-preflight.md`: required grilling and domain-modeling, sourced decisions, and authorization through Close. Reuse confirmed answers and valid completed preflights; a complete-looking plan cannot skip the workflow. Record completion, reuse or explicit user-skip evidence. `grill-with-docs` remains explicit-only. Estimates are optional; cleanup defaults to `Disabled`, and `Enabled` needs explicit authorization.

## Request Supersession

Read the newest request before goal work. Explicit pause, stop, redirect or scope change overrides every continuation case. Otherwise:

- Continue for execution, resume, advancement, close, or same-goal status, evidence, clarification or progress.
- Pause for unrelated planning, explanation, alignment, skill editing, review-only analysis, Git maintenance or another bounded task.
- A plan-change request updates the goal and current indexes only unless execution is also requested. Resolve ambiguous scope by inspecting or answering the bounded request before resuming stale work.

While paused, answer without milestone commands, goal-evidence edits or native goal-status updates.

## Branch Routing

Read every matching reference, not the whole lifecycle:

- Create/upgrade or define a Loop-shaped harness: `references/create-and-loop.md`.
- Create, authorize, promote, resume or close `Sequence Child Goals`: `references/sequence-child-goals.md` plus the matching lifecycle branch.
- Production cutover against an authoritative old path: `references/production-cutover.md`.
- Execute, resume, continue, advance or evolve: `references/execute-and-close.md`.
- Enter Close: `references/close.md`; do not load it during ordinary execution.

Branches own their detail and completion criteria; inline contracts always apply. After creation, upgrade or evolution, update necessary current-doc pointers and keep milestone detail in the goal file.

## Execution Authority

Before `Ready`, freeze necessary local operations, all external reads/writes (including connectors, APIs, issues, PRs, CI, automation, hooks and messaging), runtime hard stops, rollback and temporary-cache policy. Record approval source, action, target, scope and conditions under the preflight's existing authority owners.

On execution/resume, read those sources and later changes before asking. Still-covered authority survives milestones and context transitions; satisfying an approval condition needs no renewed approval. Ask only for uncovered increments or sourced final-review gates.

Planned non-destructive local operations are non-stops: reviews, checkpoints, rebuilds, refreshes, dependency restores, edits, tests, formatting and link checks. Continue when gates pass. Apply `components/milestone-scope-gate.md` at its defined boundaries; it constrains unplanned expansion, never work frozen by the user, goal, repository, review gate or checkpoint.

Diagnose ordinary technical failures with [adaptive recovery](references/execute-and-close.md#adaptive-recovery). The first and second runtime-reported native Goal failures are opportunities to change strategy within existing authority, not reasons to declare the goal blocked or repeat an unchanged failed approach. The third runtime-reported native Goal failure reaches the native Codex Goal hard stop; do not extend or reset that limit in this skill.

Ask only at a runtime hard stop: an uncovered authorization boundary (including a sourced final-review gate, denied access, or a scope/product-semantic change requiring a decision), or the native Goal technical-failure stop. Stop the affected action immediately at an authorization boundary; never spend retry opportunities probing or routing around it.

Missing credentials, files, tools, source inputs, subagents, connectors, worktrees or verifiers first require diagnosis and authorized recovery. Local absence or one failed method alone is not technical impossibility. Preserve required methods, gates, scope and acceptance criteria when changing strategy. If no authorized useful alternative exists, report the exact external dependency and wait for it; do not manufacture attempts, claim success, or silently relax a required gate.

Stop the affected action, not at status checkpoints. Finish independent authorized work within the current milestone without bypassing gates or advancing past an incomplete milestone, unless the native runtime has already stopped execution. Record recovery evidence in the existing milestone so a context transition does not restart failed approaches.

Temporary-cache housekeeping uses only preflight's recorded policy and owner paths. Never infer cleanup consent from YOLO scope, skipped grilling or generic cleanup language.

## Harness Goal Tool Boundary

Use native goal tools only on an explicit active-conversation request to create, execute, resume or close a long-running goal; a planning document alone is not an active native goal. Set the project outcome, add a token budget only if requested, and avoid nested active goals. Complete only when no required work remains; block only at an authorization boundary or the native technical-failure threshold with no meaningful progress left. Native stop signals take precedence; the skill neither implements a second counter nor overrides runtime counting/reset semantics. Do not recreate, rename or resume a stopped native goal merely to obtain more attempts.

The goal document, milestone states, validation, commits or equivalent revisions and final report remain the durable authority; native status does not replace them.

## Completion

Use the deterministic owners for the affected lifecycle:

```bash
python <skill-folder>/scripts/check_goal_ready.py [--allow-draft] <goal-file>
python <skill-folder>/scripts/check_goal_sequence.py <sequence-file> [--allow-draft]
python <skill-folder>/scripts/check_md_links.py <planning-root>
python <skill-folder>/scripts/check_todo_index.py [--mode active|closed|absent] [--archived-goal <archive-path>] <goal-file> <index-file> [<index-file> ...]
```

Creation/upgrade follows its Draft/Ready criteria and maintains active navigation. Execution advances only after scope, validation, review, rollback, risk and checkpoint evidence are recorded. Close must satisfy `references/close.md`, including every milestone, docs, temporary-cache disposition, active navigation, archive/delete handling and close evidence.

Report goal path, lifecycle state, current/next milestone, triggered branches, authority and hard-stop boundary, validation evidence, blockers and residual risk.
